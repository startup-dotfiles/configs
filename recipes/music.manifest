## Music Player

## Requirements:
## - Deamon: mpd
## - CLI: mpc
## - Clients:
##     - ncmpcpp
##     - rmpc


## NOTE: My configuration is set up to run with user permissions by default,
##  which means no permission changes are required to use it.
##
## Only enable the user service
## system --user enable --now mpd.service
##
## mpd (Deamon)
services/mpd/mpd.conf|symlink|.config/mpd

## NOTE: MPD also needs audio backends, such as PipeWire or ALSA. You need to install them.
## These packages's default configuration works out of the box.
## Here are some of my personal settings for reference.
##
## pipewire (Audio backend)
#services/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-sound.conf|symlink|.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
#services/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/20-no-resampling.conf|symlink|.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d

## NOTE: MPD' clients
## Although I minimized hardcoding so it works without changes, some settings had to be hardcoded.
## Because they can't read environment variables or for other reasons â€” you should check them to ensure they work on your device.
